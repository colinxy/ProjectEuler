# Project Euler

[project euler](projecteuler.net) is a website that offers challenging math and computer science problems. 

Starting around May, 2014, I have been solving problems on project euler, both for fun and for learning. By solving these problems, I have improved both my math skills and algorithmic thinking skills.

Feel free to contact me if my code can be improved or you are simply interested in project euler.

All code are for learning purposes only. Please write your own code before submitting the answer.
