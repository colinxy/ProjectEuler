* LISP

The directory of my project euler repo will not only serve
as my archive of lisp solutions for project euler problems,
but also my experiment in lisp.

** Resource

I have massive appreciation for Mark Brown, the author of this
blog, who have enough patience to write
[[https://blog.lowsnr.net/category/computing/lisp/][this blog]]
that provides great information for a new comer in lisp like myself.

I have been following his series of (old) blog posts on
*getting started with common lisp*.
